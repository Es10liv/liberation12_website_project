<h3>MAP-Ann Arbor Community Group Meeting with SOAP Outreach</h3>
<p>August 27, 2017</p>
<p>Michigan Abolitionist Project (MAP) is a grassroots organization focused on prevention and ending human trafficking in Michigan and beyond. MAP works to raise awareness and mobilize communities to take action, including the restoration of hope and dignity to the survivors of modern slavery. MAP Community Groups are a group of concerned citizens who work together to address slavery in their community. MAP Ann Arbor is led and organized by volunteers to conduct awareness events and engage in service projects in the local community. We seek to empower community members to use their gifts, talents and resources to address human trafficking and its root causes. </p>

<h3>End Human Trafficking Run To Set Her Free 5k Color Run!</h3>
<p>September 9, 2017</p>
<p>Stoney Creek Metro Park
4300 Main Park Drive, Shelby Twp., MI 48316</p>
<p>Proceeds from the race will support victims of human trafficking on their journey to freedom by placing them in a 2-year rehabilitation program through the organization, Hope Against Trafficking (HAT). Modeled after the Magdalene/Thistle Farms model from Nashville, HATâ€™s restorative program provides a variety of services that will help victims leave the program with dignity, independence, and stability. Victims will have rent-free housing, professional trauma therapy, individualized case management, life and job skills, and legal support. Roughly 75% of the women who made it through the first 6 months of the Magdalene program were drug-free, pursuing education and employment 2 years later-a percentage unrivaled by any treatment center.</p>
