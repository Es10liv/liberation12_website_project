<h2>Messages From the CEO</h2>
<h4>Sunday, October 8, 2017:</h4>
<p>I have been rereading and reflecting on a story (2 Kings 6:24-7:20) that we read in church this weekend.  What I've gleaned from it is applicable to what we are working toward with The Liberation12 Foundation, which is what I've shared below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>"After further study and reflection on my own time, I notice that the writing style of this passage indicates that it may have been recorded for a purpose other than to simply document a historical event.  The author seems to be including details on a discretionary basis in order to illustrate a point: We will live in a constant state of famine until we place our trust in God to supply for our every need.  The officer is an example of the psychological concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy.  To follow God we must be willing to believe in and hope for the impossible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As we move forward with our organization and through life, let's not set our expectations too low in order to protect ourselves from feeling let down.  I truly believe that our mission to help people heal from sex-trafficking is God-honoring, and I believe that God will honor and provide for our efforts to care for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us go forth into the world with a message of hope, living boldly and demanding that every captive be set free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Angela Holcomb, CEO</p>
<p>The Liberation12 Foundation, Inc.</p>
