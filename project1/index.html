<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3>Our Creed</h3>
<p>The Liberation12 Foundation is an organization rooted in the love and mercy demonstrated by Jesus Christ.  We hold ourselves to the standard of caring for all people and especially focus our attention to providing avenues of freedom to victims of trafficking so that they can live life to the fullest.</p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>The Liberation12 Foundation began with a dream.  Co-founder, Angela Holcomb, spent three years researching and developing the mission we serve today.  Our team's community involvement has opened our eyes to SE Michigan's needs.</p>	
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>The Liberation12 Foundation spreads awareness to the realities of human sex trafficking in the SE Michigan area and mobilizes passionate volunteers to bring hope and healing to our community.</p>	
<h3>Our Vision</h3>	
<p>The Liberation12 Foundation exists to aid in the establishment of safe-house rehabilitation programs and social enterprise ventures in the SE Michigan area.  We will accomplish this objective by nurturing developing organizations into established residential rehabilitation programs and providing the necessary funding subsequent to the successful completion of our specialized training curriculum.  We have also established our own social enterprise, which serves as a outlet for training in the skilled trades (sewing) and provides employment opportunities for members of rehabilitation programs in SE Michigan.</p>
